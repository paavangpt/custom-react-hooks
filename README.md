With the fast development of the react framework and the increase in usage on a daily basis,
I feel like these custom hooks can help us simplify a lot of task very much and also save the time while doing so. 
This project contains a few custom react hooks I wrote while learning ReactJS.

I hope this helps not just me but anyone out there who use these. ðŸ˜„
